Hi, it's me, Alex! I like doing devops, infrastructure and cloud stuff. I love the challenge of automating processes and finding efficient solutions that make life easier for development teams.

I like learning new things, which is why I started this blog, which also serves as a personal documentary. Also as you can see below, I like to explore the world.
